# analog-clock

## Purpose
First forray into the Date and animation of CSS.


## Future Developments
This will eventually fork into a stopwatch application with an infinite number of stopwatches running at the same time.

### Example
Let's say you are making dinner, and you want to walk away from the boiling water so you can watch something on TV. The can of ACME Spagetti says it must be at a rolling boil for 15 minutes, but you know that you enjoy the Spagetti mor eon the crunchier side.

You have never used ACME Spagetti before, so you don't know quickly the noodles will get to their perfect sweet spot of "done". You want to check it every 3 minutes to measure how well it's working, but you don't want to lose track of the overall boil time.
